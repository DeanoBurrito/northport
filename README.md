![Huge stylish northport banner](docs/images/banner.png)

Here lives the northport kernel (npk) and some support libraries. This is the third
iteration of this project, for previous attempts see the `iteration-X` git branches.
The kernel currently only supports x86_64, ports for m68k and aarch64 are planned.

To get started building or hacking on northport, you can clone the master branch of
the repo and run `make` for further instructions.

Northport is my personal hobby operating system - it's not something that I would
recommend for any serious usage. There may be bugs, and my responses may take time. 
I do still appreciate any reports sent my way though.

## Project Goals
1) To build a usable and relatively complete kernel. It should also be extensible
(via drivers) to add support for new architectures, platforms and devices.
2) The system should be self hosting, including cross compiling.
3) Useful documentation, not just the external interfaces, but the internal workings.

## Glorious Screenshots
*coming soon (tm)* - currently there's not much going on, and much less to look at.
