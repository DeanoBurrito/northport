- Updated to use limine v5:
    - Since the bootloader now supports riscv, the boot shim for that platform was removed. It'll be uploaded as a separate project for anyone who wants to use it.
    - With the shim being removed, the device tree parser no longer needs to operate with the 'no allocation' constraint, so it's been rewriten to be efficient and build a tree in memory. Previously it parsed chunks of the device tree for every operation. It operates like smoldtb without the statically allocated buffer.
    - Bootable ISO for riscv64 is now included in the releases tab.
- Documentation improvements:
    - Earlier chapter rewritten to be more consistent.
    - Added VMM chapter.

- Added development cache (develcache): limine and any OVMF firmware files for testing are downloaded and cached inside the project directly, reducing setup for getting started with the project.
    - This is opt-out, and you can point the build system to your own limine and OVMF firmware files if you prefer that.
- Kernel/riscv: now uses `tp` for core-local info instead of reading `sscratch` everytime. Thanks to xvanc and sigterm for the feedback.
- Kernel/riscv: support for acpi based initialization, in addition to the device tree.
- Kernel: added concept of system topology, currently logical and physical cores are tracked, are as NUMA domains and their corresponding physical cores and memory.
- Moved to internal stdint.h/stddef.h headers, meaning no external headers are required for building. This removes the need for management external sysroots and platform-specific headers.
